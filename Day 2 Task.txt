Window & Document Different.

The Window and Document Object are two of the Parent Objects that we can access with JavaScript. The document object itself is subordinate to the window object. I thing every this is a DOM Tree Structures.

 The Window was already inbuilt the Chrome -> V8 Engine -> Console -> Window.

The document inbuilt to the Window -> Document.

JavaScript variable everything directly work with window Tree & any html relevant Tag work with Document Tree. Both are working each and every variable and Tag worked by DOM Tree Structure.

Window Include to Address bar, Front and Back key, Reload key everything and document only for body structure only.
